# Regular expression is a sequence of character that forms a search pattern 
# regex can use to check if a string contains the specific search pattern 

# to use regular expressio we have to import it first 
import re

# searching in a string if the stirn starts with the and ends wiht india

txt="The best country in the world is India this is no 1"

x=re.search("^The .*India$",txt)
print(x)


# The re module offers a set of function that allow us to search a string for a match 

# findall() - returns list containing all matches 
# search() - Return the match object if there is match anywere in the string 
# split() - Returns a list where the string has been split at each match 
# sub() - replace one or many matches with a string 

# Metachatracters 

y=re.findall("[a-e]",txt)  # helps fincd characters which are in between 

print(y)

# Metacharacters
# Metacharacters are characters with a special meaning:

# Character	Description	Example	Try it
# []	A set of characters	"[a-m]"	
y=re.findall("[a-e]",txt)  # helps fincd characters which are in between 

print(y)

# \	Signals a special sequence (can also be used to escape special characters)	"\d"	

z=re.findall("\d",txt)
print(z)

# .	Any character (except newline character)	"he..o"	

z=re.findall("In..a",txt) 

# ^	Starts with	"^hello"	
x=re.search("^The",txt)
print(x)
# $	Ends with	"planet$"	
x=re.search("*India$",txt)
print(x)
# *	Zero or more occurrences	"he.*o"	
x = re.findall("he.*o", txt)

# +	One or more occurrences	"he.+o"	
x = re.findall("he.+o", txt)

# ?	Zero or one occurrences	"he.?o"	
x = re.findall("he.?o", txt)

# {}	Exactly the specified number of occurrences	"he.{2}o"	
# |	Either or	"falls|stays"	
# ()	Capture and group	 	 
# Flags

# Flags
# You can add flags to the pattern when using regular expressions.

# Flag	Shorthand	Description	Try it
# re.ASCII	re.A	Returns only ASCII matches	
# re.DEBUG		Returns debug information	
# re.DOTALL	re.S	Makes the . character match all characters (including newline character)	
# re.IGNORECASE	re.I	Case-insensitive matching	
# re.MULTILINE	re.M	Returns matches at the start/end of each line	
# re.NOFLAG		Specifies that no flag is set for this pattern	
# re.UNICODE	re.U	Returns Unicode matches. This is default from Python 3. For Python 2: use this flag to return only Unicode matches	
# re.VERBOSE	re.X	Allows whitespaces and comments inside patterns. Makes the pattern more readable	
# Special Sequences
# A special sequence is a \ followed by one of the characters in the list below, and has a special meaning:

# Character	Description	Example	Try it
# \A	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the beginning of the string	"\AThe"	
# \b	Returns a match where the specified characters are at the beginning or at the end of a word
# (the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string")	r"\bain"

# r"ain\b"	

# \B	Returns a match where the specified characters are present, but NOT at the beginning (or at the end) of a word
# (the "r" in the beginning is making sure that the string is being treated as a "raw string")	r"\Bain"

# r"ain\B"	

# \d	Returns a match where the string contains digits (numbers from 0-9)	"\d"	
# \D	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain digits	"\D"	
# \s	Returns a match where the string contains a white space character	"\s"	
# \S	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain a white space character	"\S"	
# \w	Returns a match where the string contains any word characters (characters from a to Z, digits from 0-9, and the underscore _ character)	"\w"	
# \W	Returns a match where the string DOES NOT contain any word characters	"\W"	
# \Z	Returns a match if the specified characters are at the end of the string	"Spain\Z"	
# Sets
# A set is a set of characters inside a pair of square brackets [] with a special meaning:

# Set	Description	Try it
# [arn]	Returns a match where one of the specified characters (a, r, or n) is present	
# [a-n]	Returns a match for any lower case character, alphabetically between a and n	
# [^arn]	Returns a match for any character EXCEPT a, r, and n	
# [0123]	Returns a match where any of the specified digits (0, 1, 2, or 3) are present	
# [0-9]	Returns a match for any digit between 0 and 9	
# [0-5][0-9]	Returns a match for any two-digit numbers from 00 and 59	
# [a-zA-Z]	Returns a match for any character alphabetically between a and z, lower case OR upper case	
# [+]	In sets, +, *, ., |, (), $,{} has no special meaning, so [+] means: return a match for any + character in the string
